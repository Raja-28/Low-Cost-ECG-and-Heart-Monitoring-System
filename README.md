 Introduction

This project provides a low-cost solution for monitoring heart activity using an ECG sensor. The system captures ECG signals, processes them, and visualizes the heart rate in real time. It can be used in both clinical and non-clinical environments for early detection of cardiac conditions.

 Features

- Affordable and Portable: Built with low-cost components, making it accessible to a wider audience.
- Real-time Monitoring: Continuously captures and displays ECG signals and heart rate.
- Data Storage: Logs ECG data for future analysis.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy operation.
- Open-Source: Fully open-source, allowing for community-driven improvements and customizations.

 System Architecture

The system is composed of the following main components:

1. ECG Sensor: Captures the electrical activity of the heart.
2. Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino): Processes the ECG signals and calculates the heart rate.
3. Display Module: Visualizes the ECG waveform and heart rate in real-time.
4. Power Supply: Portable power source for the entire system.
5. Optional: Bluetooth/Wi-Fi module for wireless data transmission.

 Components

- ECG Sensor Module (e.g., AD8232)
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- OLED/LED Display
- Resistors, Capacitors, and other electronic components
- Battery or Power Bank
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires
- (Optional) Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Module for wireless communication

 Setup and Installation

 Hardware Setup

1. Connect the ECG sensor to the microcontroller as per the wiring diagram provided in the `hardware` folder.
2. Attach the display module to the microcontroller.
3. Power the system using a battery or USB connection.

 Software Installation

 
1. Install the required libraries for Arduino (e.g., `Adafruit_GFX`, `Adafruit_SSD1306`).
2. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the `ecg_monitor.ino` file to your microcontroller.

 Usage

1. Power on the system.
2. Place the ECG electrodes on the patient's body as indicated in the instructions.
3. Observe the ECG waveform and heart rate on the display module.
4. (Optional) Transmit data wirelessly to a smartphone or computer for remote monitoring.

 Data Visualization

The system allows you to visualize ECG data in real-time. For advanced analysis, you can export the data to a CSV file and use software like MATLAB or Python for further processing.
